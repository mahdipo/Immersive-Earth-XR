    title: A 'NATO' for the Middle East?
    mainText: "Rumors of a new Middle Eastern military alliance are flying. They're
      significant because an \"Arab NATO\" may include Israel, signaling next steps
      in better ties between Israel and Arab neighbors. But are the rumors real?Late
      last week, the king of Jordan made headlines when he told journalists that
      he would support a military alliance in the Middle East that was similar to
      NATO.  \"I would be one of the first people that would endorse a Middle East
      NATO,\" King Abdullah II told US media outlet CNBC. \"All of us are coming
      together and saying, 'How can we help each other?' \u2026 which is, I think,
      very unusual for the region.\"  Similar rumors about the creation of an \"Arab
      NATO\" also came from other quarters.  Earlier last week, Israel's defense
      minister, Benny Gantz, said Israel had joined a new US-led network that he
      called the Middle East Air Defense Alliance, or MEAD. Gantz did not specify
      which Arab nations might also be involved. International media outlets, including
      Reuters and The Associated Press, were unable to fully verify the Israeli announcement
      or the title.  Then at the start of this week, The Wall Street Journal reported
      on secret meetings held in Egypt that saw military officials from Israel, Saudi
      Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain come together
      to discuss cooperating on defense."

    title: Putin accuses NATO of 'imperial ambitions' over Finland, Sweden membership
      offer
    mainText: "Russian President Vladimir Putin said there will be \"some tension\"
      with Sweden and Finland if they join NATO. The two countries were invited to
      join the alliance on Wednesday.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that
      there would be \"some tensions\" between Moscow and Sweden and Finland as the
      two countries were formally invited to join the NATO military alliance.  Putin
      was speaking late Wednesday during a visit to Turkmenistan's capital Asghabat.  
      His comments followed a statement from NATO leaders that Russia \"is the most
      significant and direct threat to allies' security and to peace and stability
      in the Euro-Atlantic area.\" What did Putin say? \"There is nothing to worry
      us in terms of Swedish and Finnish membership of NATO,\" Putin told journalists
      in Asghabat. \"We don't have problems with Sweden and Finland like we do with
      Ukraine... They can join whatever they want.\"  Nonetheless, Putin stressed
      that Moscow would respond in the event of military buildup in the region. 
      \"They must clearly understand that previously there were no threats to them
      \u2014 but if troops are stationed there and infrastructure established, we
      will have to respond accordingly and make the same threats to the territory
      from where threats to us are coming,\" he added.  Putin went on to say that
      there will be \"some tension\" between the two countries and Moscow.  Russia's
      president accused NATO of seeking to assert its \"supremacy\" and \"imperial
      ambitions,\" as well as using the Ukrainian people as a \"means\" for the alliance
      to \"defend its own interests.\" He also said that the West was trying to turn
      Ukraine into an \"anti-Russia.\"  Sweden and Finland to join NATO At a summit
      on Wednesday, NATO invited Sweden and Finland to join the alliance, initiating
      the membership process for the two Nordic countries. Both Helsinki and Stockholm
      had previously maintained military non-alignment.  The expansion of the alliance
      will extend its land border with Russia by more than 1,300 kilometers (808
      miles)."

      a European summit: The Czech Republic has a lot on its plate for its turn leading
      the Council of the European Union.From July 2022, Europe will be led by two
      former university rectors: Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala is a political scientist
      who served as rector of the Masaryk University in Brno from 2004 and 2011.
      His friend, musicologist Mikulas Bek, ran the institution from 2011 to 2019,
      and today serves as the Czech Republic's minister of European affairs. Under
      the leadership of both men, the Masaryk University became one of the most popular
      institutes of higher learning in the world, attaining a favorability among
      students to rival universities in Berlin or Vienna.  Fiala and Bek now want
      to repeat their success as rectors of their country's second-largest university
      in the EU by presenting the Czech Republic as part of Western Europe when iMega-summit
      in Prague Although the French presidency was already able to successfully extend
      membership candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova at the EU summit in June
      2022, the question of EU expansion and cooperation with the bloc's neighbors
      will also be the focus of the most important informal summit scheduled during
      the Czech Republic's Council presidency.  The event will take place in Prague
      in October 2022, and be the largest event of its kind, because not only EU
      member states are to take part but other European countries as well, \"from
      Iceland to Ukraine, regardless of whether they are EU members or not,\" announced
      Fiala on his Facebook page. \"It is a challenge for us, but one that we'll
      master.\"  With the event, the Czech Republic can indirectly establish a link
      to its last Council presidency in 2009, when the so-called Eastern Partnership
      between six post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan)
      and the EU was launched at a similar Prague summit.  Crisis management According
      to observers, the key to success for the Czech Republic's turn at the helm
      will be whether it can continue to support Ukraine, ensure that it does not
      lose the war to Russia, and manage the repercussions of Russian aggression.
      Beyond that, the Czech Republic will have to moderate debate around advancing
      legislative steps for the climate plan Fit for 55.  \"It will be enough if
      we are able to achieve our fundamental aims \u2014 help Ukraine, master the
      refugee crisis, and solve the energy crisis,\" as Helena Truchla, lead analyst
      at the think tank Czech Interests in the EU, told DW.  However, just as the
      Czech Republic prepares to take over the Council presidency, its government
      is being rocked by a corruption scandal at Prague City Hall in which members
      of STAN, the second-largest member in the country's current five-party ruling
      coalition, have been caught up. That, too, is reminiscent of 2009, when the
      government of Mirek Topolanek was toppled in the middle of the country's Council
      presidency.  In an attempt to defuse the situation, Education Minister and
      STAN Deputy Party Chairman Petr Gazdik immediately stepped down, even though
      he said he had nothing to do with the scandal. \"I don't want to endanger the
      government or the coalition on the eve of the EU Council presidency,\" said
      Gazdik of his resignation. In 2009, Prime Minister Topolanek had no parliamentary
      majority \u2014 that is different today. This time around, the Czech Republic's
      ruling coalition enjoys a solid majority of 108 of the body's 200 seats.  t
      takes the Council of the European Union's rotating presidency on July 1, 2022
      \u2014 and not as part of eastern Europe.  \"I would be very pleased if our
      EU presidency led to our country being perceived not as a country that seeks
      to catch up to the West, but as an EU member state with no ifs, ands, or buts,\"
      Mikulas Bek told DW. \"To do so, it is enough to exercise the role of presiding
      country with professionalism.\"  Whether or not the Czech Republic is perceived
      as a \"normal\" EU country like Denmark or Sweden will depend on little things
      like punctuality at EU negotiations, he said. Such countries did not dominate
      the EU debate stage like France or Germany, he said, but rather, they knew
      what it takes to be a good moderator.  Ukraine top of the list Prague is well
      aware that its performance presiding over the EU Council will be greatly influenced
      by Russia's aggression toward Ukraine and its effect on the the EU and the
      world.  \"It is not as if Ukraine is pushing all other issues off the table,
      but rather that we now have a giant new problem,\" says Bek. After Poland,
      the Czech Republic is probably the EU country most strongly supporting Kyiv.
      It is delivering weapons, including tanks and helicopters, and has taken in
      350,000 Ukrainian refugees.  Looking forward to winter, the Czech EU minister
      says mastering the energy crisis brought about by Russia will be a focal point.
      \"That is a central task,\" says Bek, \"one that will determine EU credibility.
      This will be a bigger test for the EU than dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.\"
      It is critical that the EU prepare sufficient capacity for liquid gas terminals
      and transport routes, he adds.Established priorities Such concerns correspond
      with the priorities that Prime Minister Petr Fiala outlined for the Czech rotating
      presidency during a press conference in Prague in mid-June. They included:
      mastering the refugee crisis and the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war;
      energy security; strengthening Europe's defense capabilities and cyber security;
      and enhancing the strategic resilience of Europe's economy and democratic institutions.
      The motto of the Czech Republic's EU Council presidency is a quote from the
      country's former president, Vaclav Havel \u2014 \"Europe as a task.\"        
      \"Europe, and with it the entire world, finds itself in a moment of profound
      transformation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shaken many of our certainties,\"
      as Fiala told reporters, while explaining that Europe must work toward creating
      a new security architecture. The Czech Republic also understands that its task
      in presiding over the EU is not defined by pushing its own interests, he said:
      \"The task of the Czech presidency will, above all, be to achieve consensus
      in individual areas and attain all-important European unity.\""

    title: 'Philippines: What the future holds under Ferdinand Marcos Jr.''s rule'
    mainText: "Rights groups and media outlets fear a continued climate of intolerance
      for dissent and shrinking civil liberties in the country.A series of arrests
      and crackdowns on media outlets in the weeks before the presidential inauguration
      of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday foreshadows a continued climate of intolerance
      for dissent and shrinking civil liberties in the Philippines, warn activists
      and human rights defenders.     On Wednesday, the country's Securities and
      Exchange Commission (SEC) upheld its 2018 ruling to shut down Rappler, the
      news organization founded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa in 2012.  The SEC said
      the outlet violated \"constitutional and statutory restrictions on foreign
      ownership in mass media.\"  In an online briefing, Ressa said that Rappler
      would appeal the SEC decision and that its journalists would continue reporting.
      \"We have plans A to Z\u2026we are not going to voluntarily give up our rights.\"  
      Ressa is fighting at least seven court cases, including an appeal against a
      conviction in a cyber libel case, for which she is out on bail and faces up
      to six years in prison. Rappler faces about eight cases, Ressa said.  But it's
      not the only media outlet that has been caught in the government's crosshairs. 
      Misuse of anti-terror laws to go after media? Earlier this month,  the National
      Security Council ordered internet service providers to shut down a list of
      websites \"found to be affiliated to and are supporting terrorists and terrorist
      organizations.\"  Websites affected by the ruling included independent media
      outlets such as Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly.  \"The recent order to block websites
      shows how easily the government can silence dissent and critical reporting
      under the cover of enforcing laws and regulations,\" Jonathan de Santos, chairperson
      of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, told DW.   \"The timing
      of it, just days before President Rodrigo Duterte stepped down, makes this
      look like a last hurrah for an administration that has been hostile to the
      press,\" he added. \"The press under Marcos Jr. will likely see the same hostility
      as we saw under Duterte, if not worse.\"The website of Amihan National Federation
      of Peasant Women, a labor rights group that has been on the receiving end of
      relentless acts of political intimidation, has also been blocked.   Amihan
      said that its website focuses on issues and demands of peasant women and the
      agriculture sector.  \"The new administration is already showing its disregard
      for human rights and press freedom. They continue to bend laws to serve their
      benefit,\" Zenaida Soriano, the rights group's chairperson, told DW.    Soriano
      said Amihan's bank accounts have also been frozen since last year due to alleged
      violations of terrorism financing rules.   \"You cannot expect anything good
      from a Marcos, Jr. and Duterte tandem. They are using the anti-terrorism law
      against citizens who are standing up to defend their rights and their livelihoods.
      This is the same legacy of their fathers,\" said Soriano.   Landslide victory
      aided by disinformation?  Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the former Philippine
      dictator, was sworn in as president on Thursday after his landslide victory
      in the recent election.  His running mate \u2014 Sara Duterte, the daughter
      of his predecessor Duterte \u2014 was sworn in as vice president earlier this
      month.  Both of them have so far failed to acknowledge the human rights atrocities
      that took place under their fathers.  Various media organizations have documented
      how Marcos Jr.'s victory was aided by a massive disinformation campaign.  Critics
      say both the Marcos and Duterte families have excelled at exploiting and manipulating
      social media to create an alternative information ecosystem with wide reach.  
      Regine Cabato, Manila correspondent for the Washington Post and a member of
      the Foreign Correspondents' Association of the Philippines, told DW that the
      disinformation campaign of Marcos Jr. ran for decades and was \"elaborate,
      moneyed, and spans different social media platforms, capturing different sectors.\" 
      \"In some ways, outgoing president Duterte's administration saw some institutionalization
      of disinformation: granting propagandists positions in government, the charges
      against the traditional press, and so on,\" Cabato said.   \"But what Duterte
      developed in 2016, Marcos Jr.'s team has almost perfected. His campaign is
      slicker and quicker than Duterte's was, with TikTok influencers and YouTube
      videos seeded for years. It's a rabbit hole and alternative universe of disinformation,\"
      he added. "

    title: Poland completes Belarus border wall to prevent migrant crossings
    mainText: The 186-kilometer long wall was built after Poland accused Belarus
      of "instrumentalizing" asylum-seekers in late 2021. Poland's prime minister
      claimed that the standoff was "the first sign" of Russia's war on Ukraine.Polish
      Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced on Thursday the completion of Poland's
      border wall with Belarus.   It's part of Poland's response to migrant crossings
      into the European Union from Belarus last year, which had turned into a political
      standoff while at the very least 20 migrants died at the border's freezing
      forests and bogs.  The wall is 5.5 meters (18 feet) high and 186 kilometers
      (115 miles) long.  What did Morawiecki say? While speaking in the border town
      of Kuznica, Poland's prime minister alleged that Belarusian leader Alexander
      Lukashenko decided to test the European Union's eastern border in preparation
      for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  "The first sign of this war was Lukashenko's
      attack on the Polish border with Belarus," Morawiecki said.  Belarus is a Russian
      ally and has served as an important staging ground for Moscow's invasion. 
      What was the standoff? In late 2021, thousands of people began attempting to
      cross into the European Union through Belarus. Brussels accused Minsk of systematically
      bringing migrants to the EU's border as a way to exert pressure on the West
      and push for the easing of sanctions.  While Poland has accepted millions of
      people fleeing the war in Ukraine, it has maintained a strict policy against
      arrivals from Belarus, who mostly originate from northern Iraq and elsewhere
      in the Middle East and Africa.  Rights organizations have accused Poland of
      illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers back toward its eastern neighbor.  Human
      Rights Watch said Poland "unlawfully and sometimes violently, summarily pushes
      migrants and asylum-seekers back to Belarus, where they face serious abuses." 
      On Friday, Polish authorities will lift a state of emergency along the border
      which blocked access to journalists, rights workers and others to the border
      region.  Meanwhile, in a sharp contrast to its treatment of refugees from Iraq,
      Syria and Afghanistan, Poland has welcomed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians
      fleeing Russia's war.   "If you give a lift to a refugee at the Ukrainian border
      you are a hero. If you do it at the Belarus border you are a smuggler and could
      end up in jail for eight years," said Natalia Gebert, founder and CEO of Dom
      Otwarty, or Open House, a Polish NGO that helps refugees.

    title: China's Xi Jinping in Hong Kong ahead of handover anniversary
    mainText: It's the first time Xi has made a trip outside mainland China since
      the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The visit is expected to showcase Beijing's
      control over Hong Kong after a political crackdown crushed dissent.Chinese
      President Xi Jinping arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday ahead of events to mark
      the 25th anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China.  The July
      1 anniversary of the handover has been marked in the past with peaceful pro-democracy
      protests with tens of thousands of people. This year, however, authorities
      are clamping down to eliminate public opposition to China's rule over the financial
      hub.  "Hong Kong has been reborn of fire," Xi said as he arrived in Hong Kong.  
      "Facts have proved that One Country, Two Systems has great vitality," the president
      continued, referencing China's official policy that regards Hong Kong as a
      region with its own systems rather than a sovereign nation.  "Hong Kong will
      have a good future if we don't waver from One Country, Two Systems," he added.  
      What is expected for Xi's trip? Xi's visit in Hong Kong on Thursday, and his
      expected appearance during anniversary events on Friday, marks the first time
      the president has traveled outside mainland China since the start of the COVID-19
      pandemic.  Details of his visit have been kept secret, but he was expected
      to make an appearance on Thursday in Hong Kong before spending the night back
      on the mainland in neighboring Shenzhen.  He is then expected to return to
      Hong Kong on Friday for events marking the handover anniversary.  Xi's last
      visit to the former British colony was in 2017 to swear in outgoing city leader
      Carrie Lam.One of Hong Kong's last remaining opposition groups, the League
      of Social Democrats, said it would not protest on July 1, stating that national
      security officers warned them against staging demonstrations during Xi's visit.  
      Hong Kong's top polling group has also held off on publishing the results of
      a survey on the government's popularity, citing a government "risk assessment." 
      What is the situation in Hong Kong? The anniversary celebrations follow turbulent
      years in Hong Kong.  Mass gatherings have essentially disappeared due to a
      combination of strict coronavirus restrictions and a crackdown on dissent under
      a new national security law.  In 2019, the financial hub was rocked by months
      of pro-democracy protests that led to the arrest of over 10,000 people.  By
      July 2020, Hong Kong enacted Beijing's national security law which criminalized
      any acts of "secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers." 
      Under the law, dozens of activists and opposition figures have been arrested,
      pro-democracy media outlets have been closed and opposition lawmakers have
      been removed from the city's legislative council.  The crackdown has added
      to the tension between Beijing and the United States, Europe, Japan and other
      Asian governments.

    mainText: It's one of the bloodiest years for press workers in Mexico, with 12
      journalists killed so far. In the latest attack, a reporter was shot dead while
      leaving his home in the state of Tamaulipas.A newspaper reporter was shot to
      death on Wednesday in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexican authorities
      said.  He is the 12th journalist to be killed in Mexico so far this year, already
      approaching its worst annual tally of 13 in recent years in a country that
      has become notoriously dangerous for reporters.  Mourning for  The journalist
      was identified as Antonio de la Cruz, who worked as a reporter for the local
      newspaper Expreso.  De la Cruz was shot while leaving his house in the city
      of Ciudad Victoria. His 23-year old daughter and wife were also seriously injured
      in the attack, state prosecutors said.  The 47-year-old regularly reported
      on rural and social topics such as water shortages. He also frequently criticized
      alleged acts of corruption by politicians on social media.  The head of Expreso,
      Miguel Dominguez, said the late reporter "never expressed any concern to us"
      about his safety.  De la Cruz was "very aware of the reality of Tamaulipas,
      very brave,'' Dominguez said in an interview with Milenio Television.  Newspaper
      targeted in the pastThe paper has been regularly targeted over the years, including
      a car bomb attack outside its offices in 2012.  In 2018, a human head was left
      outside Expreso's building, with a warning not to report on the violence taking
      place in the city.  Another Expreso reporter, Hector Gonzalez, was beaten to
      death in 2018.  Calls for investigation De la Cruz's death prompted swift condemnation
      and calls for a thorough investigation.  "We must not allow more attacks on
      journalists and activists. These crimes will not go unpunished," President
      Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's spokesman, Jesus Ramirez, wrote on Twitter. 
      Expreso called for "justice from authorities at all levels."  Rights group
      Reporters Without Borders urged authorities to launch a probe and investigate
      whether the murder was linked to de la Cruz's journalistic work.  The state
      prosecutor's office in Tamaulipas said it was investigating the killing and
      that a special unit for investigating crimes against freedom of expression
      had been informed.  Over 150 journalists have been murdered in Mexico since
      2000. The country is one of the world's most dangerous for media workers, with
      few cases resulting in convictions.

      to fly to their dream destinations after being grounded during the pandemic
      for the past two years.  \"We are angry because we are on vacation. We organized
      everything and came five hours early. It's simply a waste of time. We could
      be doing something else,\" a passenger lining up at D\xFCsseldorf Airport told

      thousands of flights in the past few weeks because of the bottlenecks. Lufthansa
      alone has canceled nearly 3,000 flights.   On Tuesday, the German flag carrier's
      chief executive, Carsten Spohr, apologized to its employees and customers for
      the travel chaos, Reuters reported.  \"We certainly made mistakes while saving
      our company and more than 100,000 jobs over the past two years,\" Spohr wrote
      in a letter to staff seen by the news agency.  \"Did we go too far in cutting
      costs here and there, under the pressure of the more than \u20AC10 billion
      ($10.5 billion) in pandemic-related losses? Certainly that, too,\" he added. 
      The company is recruiting new staff, including thousands of employees in Europe,
      but the efforts will only bear fruit in winter, Spohr said.  Governments to
      the rescue Germany has said it would bring in more temporary airport workers
      from abroad, mainly from Turkey, to ease the situation during the peak summer
      holiday season. The German government will fast-track work permits and visas
      for several thousand foreign workers, Labor Minister Hubertus Heil and Interior
      Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters on Wednesday.  The foreign workers will
      be put through the same security checks as domestic airport workers before
      being allowed to work at airports, Faeser said.  According to Germany's ADV
      airport association, about 20% of jobs in security, check-in and aircraft handling
      remain vacant.  The Portuguese government plans to nearly double border control
      staff at the country's six airports by July 4 to handle a massive surge in
      travelers. The country, one of the sunniest in Europe, has seen the number
      of passengers through its airports soar this year.  Long lines at airports
      have also prompted Spanish police to hire 500 more staff to be deployed at
      the busiest airports, including Madrid and Barcelona. Spanish flag carrier
      Iberia said earlier this month that delays at Madrid's Barajas Airport passport
      control had led to around 15,000 of its passengers missing their flight since
      March 1.  Ireland has put the army on standby to help with security at Dublin
      Airport in the event of further disruption during the summer travel period.
      More than 1,000 people missed their flights in a single day last month at the
      country's main airport because of lengthy lines. Passenger numbers at Dublin
      Airport are close to pre-pandemic levels.ges plague airports The quick rebound
      has taken the industry by surprise as it struggles to put together enough staff
      to deal with the influx of travelers at airports.  Airlines, airports and others
      in the industry were forced to downsize their workforce during the pandemic.
      But with demand returning as swiftly as it has, they are struggling to hire
      staff fast enough.  Their predicament is being made worse by the post-pandemic
      trend of people becoming more picky when it comes to jobs, shunning roles with
      poor working conditions and low wages.  \"The German labor market continues
      to be very tight. Job seekers can choose from a large number of vacancies,
      while employers have difficulties filling up open positions,\" a spokesperson
      for Frankfurt Airport operator Fraport told DW. \"Moreover, the recruitment
      process at airports is specifically complex and time-consuming. This is due
      to the fact that many operational activities in aviation take place in security-relevant
      and restricted areas.\"  Given disruptions at airports, travelers are being
      recommended to arrive at the airport up to 2.5 hours before domestic flights,
      preferably check in online and make sure their cabin bags are packed right
      to help avoid delays at the security checkpoints.nnel \u2014 and that's stupid.
      You pay a lot of money for your flight, so it's annoying if you miss it,\"
      another traveler said.  The logjams at European hubs such as Frankfurt, London
      and Paris are also threatening to take the shine off the aviation industry's
      recovery from its pandemic lows in 2020, when it lost more than $230 billion

    mainText: The Vietnamese government's commitment to action on climate change
      is in the spotlight after a leading environmental activist was sentenced this
      month to two years in prison on murky charges of "tax evasion."Nguy Thi Khanh,
      a prominent activist and the first Vietnamese recipient of the prestigious
      Goldman Environmental Prize, was arrested by the police in February.      On
      June 17, she was sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty
      of "tax evasion," a new tactic of repression by the country's communist government.  
      Khanh, part of a team of civil-society actors informally overseeing the implementation
      of the EU-Vietnam free trade deal, rose to fame in 2016 after pressuring the
      government to commit to cutting 20,000 megawatts of coal power from energy
      plans by 2030.  The US and the EU have called for her release, while her case
      has left political commentators to speculate on Hanoi's commitment to environmental
      protection.  In early June, the British magazine The Economist dubbed Vietnam
      "a bright spot on an otherwise soot-black map" for climate change action in
      Southeast Asia. In 2021, it became one of the top 10 producers of solar power
      in the world, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.  The
      share of its electricity generated by solar increased from almost zero in 2017
      to nearly 11% last year.  Vietnam's government has vowed to stop building new
      coal-powered plants and, at the UN climate summit in Glasgow last year, Prime
      Minister Pham Minh Chinh said coal consumption would end by 2040.  He said
      he also wanted to cut emissions to net-zero by 2050, an uphill struggle, given
      that the country's energy needs are set to increase as its economy grows rapidly
      and citizens become more prosperous.

    mainText: "Wednesday marks one year since a violent clampdown on pro-democracy
      activists that left dozens of people dead, many injured and several arrested
      in the tiny southern African country of Eswatini.Police and troops were deployed
      across Eswatini's major cities for Wednesday's anniversary of bloody pro-democracy
      protests.  Security forces patrolled the capital, Mbabane, and the city of
      Manzini, 40 kilometers (25 miles) away. Helicopters were also reported flying
      constantly overhead.  Eswatini \u2014 formerly known as Swaziland \u2014 is
      one of the last remaining absolute monarchies in the world. According to the
      constitution, King Mswati III is not bound to any law. And he takes great advantage
      of it.   Anger against the king had been building for years in the country.  
      What did the protesters demand? Activists accused the king of running a repressive
      government and evading calls for reforms.  The king had also been accused of
      using public coffers to fund a lavish lifestyle off the backs of 1.5 million
      citizens, most of them subsistence farmers.  Demonstrations first erupted in
      May following the death of a 25-year-old law student, reportedly at the hands
      of police.  The UN human rights office pointed to reports of \"disproportionate
      and unnecessary use of force, harassment and intimidation\" by security forces
      sent in to quell escalating protests.  Protests against Eswatini's monarchy
      system broke out on June 29, 2021, led by young people, particularly high school
      and university students, in response to the country's lack of development and
      opportunities.  Security forces hit back violently, firing gunshots and tear
      gas to disperse the protesters, witnesses said."

    title: Can heat pumps be the answer to higher energy costs?
    mainText: "As the price for oil and gas explodes in Europe, heat pumps could
      be a meaningful alternative. In Germany, lavish state subsidies are making
      the idea even more attractive for single-family homes.With blistering summer
      temperature around much of Europe, it may be hard to convince people to think
      about heat pumps. But a push for more renewable energy plus the ongoing war
      in Ukraine and the curtailing of Russian gas and oil means there has hardly
      been a more pressing time.  A heat pump is a system that moves around thermal
      energy. There are a number of different types of devices based on what they
      use, including exhaust air, ground and water.  Ground-source heat pump equipment
      taps into the nearly constant temperature below the soil's surface. These geothermal
      heat pumps draw heat into a building in winter and remove warm air in summer,
      acting like an air-conditioner. This type of system uses a network of water-filled
      pipes that are either laid horizontally a few feet underground or pipes drilled
      vertically much deeper into the Earth's core.  Advocates say the systems can
      be used nearly anywhere and are cheaper to run than other heating and air-conditioning
      systems like boilers, furnaces and electric radiators. As energy costs skyrocket
      they are a way to access energy locally. Most important for many customers,
      heat pumps run on electricity and not gas or oil.The heating and air-conditioning
      manufacturer Viessmann is showing the way. It is one of the market leaders
      in Germany. At the beginning of May when the company presented its annual earnings
      report, it announced that it would \u20AC1 billion ($1.05 billion) more in
      the production of heat pumps.  The company, which has 13,000 employees worldwide,
      recorded a 41% increase in sales in the heat pump sector in the past financial
      yThe necessary investments can quickly run into the tens of thousands of euros.
      The state covers up to 35% of the installation costs in old buildings, and
      45% if an oil burner is replaced. Most of the costs for a professional energy
      check are also reimbursed.  With such incentives in place it is no mystery
      why demand for heat pumps is growing. This has led to long wait times for an
      energy consultation or for workers to come and install a system. The sector,
      like many others, is facing a labor shortage, supply chain problems and sudden
      price hikes.  The war in Ukraine is making oil and gas unpalatable The Russian
      war in Ukraine and the price of fossil fuels is another reason for increased
      pressure to move away from oil and gas for heating. But can electric-powered
      heat pumps solve acute energy problems?  \"There is a very simple answer: Heat
      pumps can completely replace today's heating technologies, when you take into
      consideration hybrid heat pumps that combine gas and electricity,\" according
      to Thomas Nowak from the Brussels-based European Heat Pump Association, which
      says it represents the majority of the European heat pump industry.  Heat pumps
      are one of the key building blocks for the energy transition and for making
      the building sector climate-neutral, Christian Stolte from the German Energy
      Agency (dena) told DW. \"Heat pumps use renewable energy and can generate three
      to four units of heat from one unit of electricity,\" he said.ear, while total
      sales grew by just 21% to \u20AC3.4 billion.  These figures are a reflection
      of a swing toward electric heat pump technology. Not least because of large
      subsidies from the federal government to support the technology. Originally
      these subsidies were designed to reduce emissions of climate-damaging CO2.
      Now increasing energy costs have put these incentives in the national spotlight. 
      The initial outlay for heat pumps Heat pumps are significantly more expensive
      than gas or oil heaters because their technology and design are more complex.
      Installation is also more complex and takes longer. Many components are located
      outside of buildings. The buildings themselves must be well insulated. Underfloor
      heating systems or extra-large radiators make a heat pump more efficient. 
      \"In almost all cases, the conversion goes hand in hand with structural changes
      and often with a more energy-efficient renovation of the entire building,\"
      Thomas Auer, a professor of building technology and climate-friendly construction
      at the Technical University of Munich, told DW."

    title: Iraqi prime minister visits Tehran to push for Iran-Saudi talks
    mainText: Baghdad is hoping to revive talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia following
      the deadly confrontation in Yemen. Diplomatic ties between Tehran and Riyadh
      have been non-existent for years.Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi met
      with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on Saturday, a day after visiting
      Saudi Arabia, Iranian state TV reported.  "We have agreed to work together
      to bring stability and calm to the region," Kadhimi said in a joint televised
      news conference with Raisi.   Al-Kadhimi's trip aims at reviving talks between
      Riyadh and Tehran, although the two leaders remained non-committal while addressing
      the press.  "Dialogue with regional officials can resolve the regional issues,"
      Raisi said, without elaborating.  Iraq, like Iran, is a majority Shiite country,
      but also maintains relations with Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia. Keeping balanced
      relations with its two larger neighbors has been a key policy for al-Kadhimi's
      administration since he came to power.  Shift amid West-Russia standoff Al-Kadhimi
      visit comes a day after his meeting with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed
      bin Salman in the Saudi city of Jeddah.   It also comes as Western leaders
      seem to be trying to improve ties with oil and gas-rich countries amid the
      faceoff with Russia. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell traveled to Tehran
      on Friday and announced the long-stalled talks on Iran's nuclear program are
      set to continue in the coming days. country in response to the execution of
      Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr by Saudi authorities.  The two powers have also
      indirectly confronted each other in Yemen, in what is generally seen as a proxy
      war. Saudi Arabia has backed the ousted Yemeni government while Iran supports
      the Houthi rebels.  However, a recent truce in Yemen has sought to bring an
      end to the conflict that has triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian
      disasters.  Attempts to heal the yearslong tensions between Tehran and Riyadh
      were made in low-key talks in Baghdad last year, but these were suspended following
      the execution of some 40 Shiite citizens.

    title: With vast arable lands, why does Africa need to import grain?
    mainText: "Despite having vast amounts of arable land, nutritious indigenous
      crops and a booming agricultural sector, Africa still imports most of its grain.The
      Russian army\u2019s blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports and the ripple effects
      of Western sanctions against Moscow have raised international food and fuel
      prices, leaving millions of Africans facing an \"unprecedented food emergency\"
      this year, the World Food Programme has said.   Kenya, Somalia, and large parts
      of Ethiopia are at risk of acute food insecurity, theUN's Food & Agriculture
      Organization saidthis week. In Sahel and West Africa, more than 40 million
      people could go hungry in 2022, according to the FAO, up from 10.8 million
      people in 2019.   Even before the Russian invasion in late February, the pandemic
      and a long period of drought had already hit African economies hard. The war
      in Ukraine made things critically worse since the continent imported about
      a third of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. With food prices skyrocketing
      in global markets, even those countries not reliant on imports from Russia
      and Ukraine are suffering.  Over the past decade, Africa's food import bill
      has nearly tripled, but its agricultural sector has also been growing steadily.
      The continent has immense potential for feeding itself, with vast amounts of
      arable lands. But why is it still dependent on imported grain?  Africans produce
      food, but not for themselves  A major part of African farmlands is used to
      grow crops such as coffee, cocoa, and cottonseed oil for export, while the
      staple crops of the African diet, wheat, and rice, mainly come from outside
      of the continent.  Much of this imported food could be produced locally,according
      to the World Bank, while African countries' self-sufficiency could also be
      boosted by replacing foreign cereal with regional crops such asThat view changed
      once NGOs and the government began to support the local production of vegetables.
      \"They first found their way to the local day markets, and soon after were
      introduced in chain supermarkets at a national level,\" he said.  In addition
      to their health benefits and ecological advantages, \"indigenous crops can
      empower subaltern communities, especially female farmers,\" Bokelmann said.
      \"There are many types of crops that can grow in home gardens in cities' margins
      within a short period of time.\"  With the continuous trend of migration from
      villages to cities in Africa, constellations of small plots of indigenous crop
      farms around the cities can count for vital food sources for the ever-expanding
      population of slums and marginal communities, he noted.  Dilemmas and challenges
      But Chivenge is aware that boosting indigenous crop production faces many hurdles.
      The smallholder farmers who grow them have limited access to fertilizers, which
      keeps their productivity low. They also lack the means to process and market
      their harvests, and fresh, unprocessed food needs quick shipment, which is
      not an option in most intra-African markets.    Furthermore, African countries
      cannot simply switch to the production of indigenous crops when exporting cash
      crops to richer countries is more profitable.  \"Most of these nations are
      faced with a dilemma,\" Bokelmann said. \"They are forced to choose between
      the mass production of crops for exporting, which brings them more price value,
      or feeding the majority of their population by supporting small-scale farming
      of indigenous crops.\"   fon\"Indigenous crops could offer much healthier alternatives
      to the cereals currently in use,\" Pauline Chivenge, a researcher at the African
      Plant Nutrition Institute in Morocco, told DW. \"They have  benefits that go
      beyond sustaining food security. They are more nutritious, so in addition to
      the necessary callories, they contain higher amounts of protein and vitamins.\" 
      Yet indigenous crops have been neglected for decades, largely due to states
      and international companies pushing for the mass production of maize and wheat
      and promoting them as staples. \"Research and development and mechanization
      have focused on maize, rice, and wheat, and producing them in large, mono-crop
      fields at the expense of the region\u2019s biodiversity,\" Chivenge said. 
      \"But the fact is that grains like maize and wheat are not really suitable
      for growing in most regions of Africa, where water is in short supply,\" she
      added. \"They are very much dependent on regular rainfall, which is becoming
      a real challenge in the wake of climate change.\"  Can smallholder farmers
      feed Africa with indigenous crops? Wolfgang Bokelmann, food and agriculture
      economist at Humboldt University in Berlin, agrees that local crops are underutilized.
      Between 2015 to 2018 he oversaw a study on the local production and consumption
      of a group of indigenous vegetables in Kenya. \"The vegetables we studied had
      previously fallen out of fashion and used to be known as the poor man's food,
      due to dominance of the foreign produce that colonialization brought to Kenya,\"
      he told DW.io, teff, sorghum, amaranth, and millet. African countries could
      trade these crops between themselves, creating much-needed jobs for their youth
      and income for their farmers. The crops would also serve as the basis for a
      healthy diet."

      reporters about the purpose of his visit to Turkmenistan.   \u201CThis visit
      is taking place at the invitation of the esteemed president of the brotherly
      and friendly country of Turkmenistan in order to attend the Caspian Sea littoral

      in addition to reviewing the legal regime of the Caspian Sea and peaceful use
      of the sea for the purpose of improving security at the sea, what will be discussed
      at the sixth summit of the Caspian Sea littoral states is cooperation between
      countries in the fields of transport, transit, trade, management of marine
      living resources, environment, as well as preventing the presence of outsiders
      in the sea, which is also agreed upon by all coastal countries.\u201D  Prior
      to the beginning of the summit, Raisi met Serdar Berdimuhamedow, Turkmenistan\u2019s
      President, as well as Chairman of the People's Council of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly
      Berdimuhamedow.  During the meeting with the President of Turkmenistan, Raisi
      pointed out that the implementation of the memoranda of understanding and cooperation
      documents signed by the two countries during Berdimuhamedow\u2019s recent visit
      to Tehran will accelerate promotion of cooperation between the two countries. 
      Later, Raisi met with the Azerbaijani President, Ilham Aliyev.   During the
      meeting, Raisi reminded Aliyev that the presence of the Israeli regime in any
      part of the world undermines security there.  The president also had a brief
      meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the
      summit.   There\u2019s little doubt that Tehran has not put all its eggs into
      the basket of the JCPOA revival, as it actively seeks to establish trade relations
      with the neighbors. It\u2019s short-sighted thinking to assume that Iran has
      to wait for the United States to return to the JCPOA, while it can enjoy the
      benefits of regional alliances such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
      (SCO), or BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).   On Monday,
      Iran\u2019s former Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh, who was holding
      his last presser, told the Tehran Times correspondent that Tehran has submitted
      a membership request to the BRICS secretariat via Foreign Minister Hossein

      has already officially informed the United Nations of Australia\u2019s more
      ambitious 2030 target than the previous conservative Liberal Party-led administration
      had pursued, a reduction of 26% to 28%.But Bowen said legislating the 43% target
      would create greater confidence.  \u201CIt\u2019s about certainty and stability,
      mainly for the business investment community,\u201D Bowen said.  \u201CIt sends
      a signal if a parliament hasn\u2019t legislated that maybe the country\u2019s
      not serious. Maybe a future government, heaven forbid a Liberal government,
      might walk it back,\u201D Bowen added.  Opposition leader Peter Dutton has
      ruled out his Liberal Party senators getting the Labor target through the upper
      chamber. Labor holds only 26 seats in the 76-seat Senate so needs outside help
      to pass its legislative agenda.  If Labor got all 12 senators from the minor
      Greens party to support the target, the government would only need to persuade
      one of six remaining independent or unaligned legislators to reach a majority. 
      Greens leader Adam Bandt has said he will push the government to ban new coal
      mines and gas projects when that target legislation is negotiated. The Greens
      want Australian emissions reduced by 75% by 2030.  Australia\u2019s greenhouse
      gas emissions rose last year by 0.8%, or 4.1 million metric tons (4.5 million
      U.S. tons).  Bowen described the increase as one of the biggest emissions spikes
      in 15 years and blamed the previous government\u2019s inaction during nine
      years in office.  Factors that caused the increase included a 4% rise in transport
      emissions as pandemic travel restrictions eased and 4.2% more agricultural
      emissions as rain ended years of drought across large swathes of southeast
      Australia.."
